# Introduction text

The gender pay gap is the systemic difference in pay between men and women. In the United States, this difference is usually 
simplified to saying that women earn 84 cents on the dollar compared to men. However, as Allison Elias states in an interview from the 
article *Why the Gender Pay Gap Persists in American Businesses*, this "statistic provides an incomplete picture of womenâ€™s
experiences in the labor market since the gap is exacerbated for many women of color. Hispanic and Black women 
experience the largest gaps relative to white, non-Hispanic men...Important to note is that even though women in the 
highest-paid work face the highest wage gap penalties, in general women remain overrepresented in the lowest-paying occupations. 
And occupations with greater proportions of women tend to pay less even when controlling for educational and skill requirements"(1). 

Understanding and addressing this issue is an incredibly important social issue. Unsurprisingly, acknowledgement of and concern about the gender pay
gap varies across political, economic, and other social divides. To also understand these divisions in opinion, we can turn to the GSS. 
The GSS (General Social Survey) is a nationally representative survey of US adults examining a wide range of attitudes
and beliefs related to civil liberties, morality, national spending priorities, and many others. It is a tool that "allows researchers
to examine the structure and functioning of society in general"(2).

# Variable explanation
var_explanation = """
The GSS data contains the following features:

* `id` - a numeric unique ID for each person who responded to the survey
* `weight` - survey sample weights
* `sex` - male or female
* `education` - years of formal education
* `region` - region of the country where the respondent lives
* `age` - age
* `income` - the respondent's personal annual income
* `job_prestige` - the respondent's occupational prestige score, as measured by the GSS using the methodology described above
* `mother_job_prestige` - the respondent's mother's occupational prestige score, as measured by the GSS using the methodology described above
* `father_job_prestige` -the respondent's father's occupational prestige score, as measured by the GSS using the methodology described above
* `socioeconomic_index` - an index measuring the respondent's socioeconomic status
* `satjob` - responses to "On the whole, how satisfied are you with the work you do?"
* `relationship` - agree or disagree with: "A working mother can establish just as warm and secure a relationship with her children as a mother who does not work."
* `male_breadwinner` - agree or disagree with: "It is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family."
* `men_bettersuited` - agree or disagree with: "Most men are better suited emotionally for politics than are most women."
* `child_suffer` - agree or disagree with: "A preschool child is likely to suffer if his or her mother works."
* `men_overwork` - agree or disagree with: "Family life often suffers because men concentrate too much on their work."

On subsequent pages, you will be able to actively explore the GSS data using these features. You can refer back to this page for reference.
